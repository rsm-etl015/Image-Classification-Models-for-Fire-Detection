# Fire Detection Model Repository

## Why the Files Are Organized Separately

Due to computational limitations, I was unable to train models on my laptop. Initially, I attempted to use Google Colab, but its runtime limit was too short for my needs. Consequently, I decided to use **Kaggle Notebooks**, which offer longer runtime sessions. However, I exhausted my **30-hour GPU quota early in the week**, forcing me to train models on **CPU only**. To manage this limitation, I had to **reduce the number of epochs** during training.  

This repository is structured to separate training, evaluation, and inference files, ensuring clarity and ease of use.

## Description of Key Files

### **Python Notebooks**
- **Training Folder**: Contains all `.ipynb` notebooks for training models with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation.ipynb**: Runs performance evaluation on trained models, including accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices.
- **MP4 Video Fire Detection.ipynb**: Accepts an MP4 video as input and detects fire occurrences in the frames.
- **Live Fire Detection.ipynb**: Uses a webcam to perform real-time fire detection.

### **Output Folder**
Each trained model (e.g., **BaselineCNN, ResNet50**) has a separate folder containing:
- **`all_result.json`**: Stores accuracy metrics for different hyperparameter combinations.
- **`all_history.json`**: Logs loss and accuracy per epoch for the best-performing model.
- **`best_model_info.json`**: Stores hyperparameter details of the best model.
- **`best_model.keras`**: The saved best model for further use.

### **Standalone Files**
- **`Input.mp4`**: The raw input video used for MP4-based fire detection.
- **`Output Video.mp4`**: The processed video with detected fire regions.
- **`DenseNet121.onnx`**: The pre-trained deep learning model used for both live webcam and MP4 fire detection.
